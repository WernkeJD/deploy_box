# deploy_box

Hello! And welcome to Deploy Box. The goal of Deploy Box is to make 
managing and scaling your applications easier. Our stacks make it simple to quickly
spin up a full stack web app that is already cloud hosted, secure, and integrated
with top of the line database providers. That way you can focus on building your 
unique functionality!

Below is a list of the basic init steps to get you started!

1. Run "pip install deploy-box-cli"
2. In your terminal type deploy-box-cli to enter our cli
3. Type "login" this will direct you to our website. If you have an account simply login and then come back to the cli. 
if not create an account and then come back to the cli and continue.
4. now you can run the "check_docker" command in the cli to see if you have docker installed and start it if so.
if you do not have docker installed it should install it for you.
5. Now you will need to ensure that you have purchased a stack on our website https://deploy-box.onrender.com
6. Now that you have a stack you can run the "download_sc" command to download the code for your pre-setup stack.


Now you should be setup with your stack. For docs on how to use your stack please visit https://deploy-box.bitdocs.ai/share/d/rOj30y8LuqP5UxIc
